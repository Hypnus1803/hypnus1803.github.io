# Profile

I am a physicist specialized in [solar physics](#) and [computational astrophysics](#), with BSc. in Physics and a MSc in Astronomy from the National University of Colombia. I have a PhD in Natural Sciences – Physics from the University of Graz (Karl-Franzens-Universität). My research focuses on the study of the [interaction between solar plasma and magnetic fields](#) at different spatial and temporal scales, combining high-resolution observations with numerical and data-analysis techniques. I have worked extensively on the visualization, acquisition, and analysis of solar images from both ground-based and space-borne telescopes. I am also an active member of the [SunPy](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/) collaboration, contributing to Python-based open-source tools for solar physics research.
