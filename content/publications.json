    "Abstract": {"Context": "The Sun's magnetic fields play an important role in various solar phenomena. Solar pores are regions of intensified magnetic field strength compared to the surrounding photospheric environment, and their study can help us better understand the properties and behaviour of magnetic fields in the Sun. In this work, we investigate the properties of magnetic fields on the boundaries of solar pores, specifically focusing on the evolution of the vertical magnetic field.",
                  "Aims": "Up to now, there exists only a single study on magnetic field properties at the boundary region of a pore. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to increase the statistics of magnetic properties determining the pore boundary region. To this aim, we study the change of the vertical magnetic field on the boundaries of six solar pores and their time evolution.",
                  "Methods": "We analyse six solar pores using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We apply image processing techniques to extract the relevant features of the solar pores and determine the boundary conditions of the magnetic fields. For each pore, the maximal vertical magnetic field is determined, and the obtained results are compared with the above-mentioned previous study.",
                  "Results": "We find the maximal vertical magnetic field values on the boundaries of the studied solar pores to range from 1400 G to 1600 G, with a standard deviation between 7.8% and 14.8%. These values are lower than those reported in the mentioned preceding study. However, this can be explained by differences in spatial resolution as well as the type of data we used. For all the pores, we find that the magnetic inclination angle lies in a range of 30 ± 7°, which is consistent with the idea that the magnetic field configuration in solar pores is mainly vertical.",
                  "Conclusions": "The vertical magnetic field is an important factor in determining the boundary of solar pores, and it plays a more relevant role than the intensity gradient. The obtained information will be useful for future studies on the formation and evolution of magnetic structures of the Sun. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of high spatial resolution data for the purpose of accurately characterising the magnetic properties of solar pores. Overall, the findings of this work contribute to the understanding of the magnetic field properties of the Sun and will be crucial for improving models of solar dynamics and magnetic flux emergence."

    "Abstract": {"Context": "The Sun features on its surface typical flow patterns called the granulation, mesogranulation, and supergranulation. These patterns arise due to convective flows transporting energy from the interior of the Sun to its surface. The other well known elements structuring the solar photosphere are magnetic fields arranged from single, isolated, small-scale flux tubes to large and extended regions visible as sunspots and active regions.",
                  "Aims": "In this paper we will shed light on the interaction between the convective flows in large-scale cells as well as the large-scale magnetic fields in active regions, and investigate in detail the statistical distribution of flow velocities during the evolution and formation of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration active region 11190.",
                  "Methods": "To do so, we employed local correlation tracking methods on data obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory in the continuum as well as on processed line-of-sight magnetograms.",
                  "Results": "We find that the flow fields in an active region can be modelled by a two-component distribution. One component is very stable, follows a Rayleigh distribution, and can be assigned to the background flows, whilst the other component is variable in strength and velocity range and can be attributed to the flux emergence visible both in the continuum maps as well as magnetograms. Generally, the plasma flows, as seen by the distribution of the magnitude of the velocity, follow a Rayleigh distribution even through the time of formation of active regions. However, at certain moments of large-scale fast flux emergence, a second component featuring higher velocities is formed in the velocity magnitudes distribution.",
                  "Conclusions": "The plasma flows are generally highly correlated to the motion of magnetic elements and vice versa except during the times of fast magnetic flux emergence as observed by rising magnetic elements. At these times, the magnetic fields are found to move faster than the corresponding plasma."

    "Abstract": {"Context": "High-resolution observations of the solar photosphere reveal the presence of fine structures, in particular the so-called Magnetic Bright Points (MBPs), which are small-scale features associated with strong magnetic field regions of the order of kilogauss (kG). It is especially relevant to study these magnetic elements, which are extensively detected in all moments during the solar cycle, in order to establish their contribution to the behavior of the solar atmosphere, and ultimately a plausible role within the coronal heating problem.",
                  "Aims": "Characterisation of size and velocity distributions of MBPs in the solar photosphere in two different datasets of quiet Sun images acquired with high-resolution solar instruments i.e. Solar Optical Telescope SOT/Hinode and the High-resolution Fast Imager HiFI/GREGOR, in the G-band (4308 Å).",
                  "Methods": "In order to detect the MBPs, an automatic segmentation and identification algorithm is used. Next, the identified features were tracked to measure their proper motions. Finally, a statistical analysis of hundreds of MBPs is carried out, generating histograms for areas, diameters and horizontal velocities.",
                  "Results": "This work establishes that areas and diameters of MBPs display log-normal distributions that are well-fitted by two different components, whereas the velocity vector components follow Gaussians and the vector magnitude a Rayleigh distribution revealing again for all vector elements a two component composition.",
                  "Conclusions": "The results can be interpreted as due to the presence of two different populations of MBPs in the solar photosphere one likely related to stronger network magnetic flux elements and the other one to weaker intranetwork flux elemens. In particular this work concludes on the effect of the different spatial resolution of GREGOR and Hinode telescopes, affecting detections and average values."

    "Abstract": "The Sun, our nearest star, is a local laboratory for studying universal physical processes. Solar physics as a discipline includes studying the Sun both as a star and as the primary driver of space weather throughout the heliosphere. Due to the Sun’s proximity, the temporal and spatial resolution of solar observations are orders of magnitude larger than those of other stars. This leads to significant differences in the data-analysis software needs of solar physicists compared with astrophysicists. The sunpy Python package is a community-developed, free, and open-source solar data analysis environment for Python. It is managed by the SunPy Project, an organization that facilitates and promotes the use of open development and open source packages like sunpy through community engagement and tools such as GitHub, mailing lists, and matrix."

    "Abstract": "A joint campaign of various space-borne and ground-based observatories, comprising the Japanese Hinode mission (Hinode Observing Plan 338, 20 - 30 September 2017), the GREGOR solar telescope, and the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT), investigated numerous targets such as pores, sunspots, and coronal holes. In this study, we focus on the coronal hole region target. On 24 September 2017, a very extended non-polar coronal hole developed patches of flux emergence, which contributed to the decrease of the overall area of the coronal hole. These flux emergence patches erode the coronal hole and transform the area into a more quiet-Sun-like area, whereby bipolar magnetic structures play an important role. Conversely, flux cancellation leads to the reduction of opposite-polarity magnetic fields and to an increase in the area of the coronal hole."
